# .append method takes one argument 
# to delete a item within the list you could either:
# 1. use the index e.g. del fullname[1]
# 2. use fullname.remove("Eldebaque")

# to check if an item inside the list, you could use a boolean in statement 
# if "Haven" in fullname:
#     print("True")

# to print out each item separately
